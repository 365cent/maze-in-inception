# Maze in Inception: An Unreal Engine 5 Prototype

## Overview
Maze in Inception is an abstract prototype game developed with Unreal Engine 5, directly inspired by the concept of a meticulously designed maze as seen through the eyes of Ariadne in the film *Inception*. This project immerses players into a beginning scenario on a platform, leading them down a ramp to enter a labyrinth. The ultimate goal is to navigate this labyrinth to find a distinctive purple light, symbolizing victory. Initially crafted as an introductory exploration into Unreal Engine 5 and the basics of 3D object creation, the vision for Maze in Inception is to progress into a full-scale 3D First-Person Shooter (FPS) puzzle game in subsequent phases.

## Features
- **Starting Platform:** An engaging launch point for players to begin their journey.
- **Ramp to the Maze:** A transition element guiding players from the starting platform into the maze entrance.
- **Abstract Maze:** A complex and thought-provoking maze layout inspired by *Inception*, offering a unique navigational challenge.
- **Objective Marker:** A glowing purple light that represents the completion goal within the maze.
